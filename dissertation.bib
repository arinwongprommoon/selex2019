	abstract = {In order to study complex dynamical systems, appropriate mathematical models that capture the system features are necessary. Biological systems, in particular, require flexible modeling approaches for their study since they exhibit variable quantifiable responses under different conditions. Moreover, data about a given biological system are often uncertain or unavailable. Here, a group of scientists from the University of Cambridge introduce Flexible Nets ({FNs}), a novel approach for the modeling, analysis, and control of biological systems. After presenting the {FN} approach, they show how a well-known system of glucose consumption and utilization by yeast can be modeled, analyzed and controlled. Then, {FNs} are used to build and analyze the first quantitative and predictive model of Wilson disease (a heritable defect in copper utilization). They demonstrate that {FN} simulations permit an evaluation of the relative efficacy of different therapeutic options.},

	abstract = {The metabolism of microorganisms is regulated through two main mechanisms: changes of enzyme capacities as a consequence of gene expression modulation (“hierarchical control”) and changes of enzyme activities through metabolite-enzyme interactions. An increasing body of evidence indicates that hierarchical control is insufficient to explain metabolic behaviors, but the system-wide impact of metabolic regulation remains largely uncharacterized. To clarify its role, we developed and validated a detailed kinetic model of Escherichia coli central metabolism that links growth to environment. Metabolic control analyses confirm that the control is widely distributed across the network and highlight strong interconnections between all the pathways. Exploration of the model solution space reveals that several robust properties emerge from metabolic regulation, from the molecular level (e.g. homeostasis of total metabolite pool) to the overall cellular physiology (e.g. coordination of carbon uptake, catabolism, energy and redox production, and growth), while allowing a large degree of flexibility at most individual metabolic steps. These properties have important physiological implications for E. coli and significantly expand the self-regulating capacities of its metabolism.},

Similarly, up-modulation of single genes, and hence of the dependent enzyme concentrations, is frequently found to be ineffective in increasing the flux in the pathway in which the enzyme occurs. This insensitivity to enzyme variation is demonstrated experimentally for five separate enzymes in the tryptophan synthesis system of yeast, first by down-modulation of the gene dose and secondly by increasing the dose using multi-copy vectors. Such a lack of response is discussed in terms of the concepts of metabolic control analysis. When these five enzymes, however, were simultaneously increased by a multi-copy vector carrying all five genes, a substantial elevation of the flux to tryptophan was observed. These findings revealed a new phenomenon, namely the more than additive effects on the flux of simultaneous elevations of several enzyme activities.},

As expected, the control coefficient (i.e., the relative increase in pathway flux, divided by the relative increase in amount of enzyme) of enzyme {IIGlc} decreased in magnitude if a more extensive pathway was considered. Thus, at the wild-type level of enzyme {IIGlc} activity, the control coefficient of this enzyme on the growth rate on glucose and on the rate of glucose oxidation was low, while the control coefficient on uptake and phosphorylation of methyl alpha-glucopyranoside (an enzyme {IIGlc}-specific, nonmetabolizable glucose analog) was relatively high (0.55 to 0.65).

Jojima, M. Fujii, E. Mori, M. Inui, and H. Yukawa, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 87:159–165, 2010). In this study, we employ stepwise overexpression and chromosomal integration of a total of four genes encoding glycolytic enzymes (herein referred to as glycolytic genes) to demonstrate further successive improvements in C. glutamicum glucose metabolism under oxygen deprivation. In addition to {gapA}, overexpressing pyruvate kinase-encoding pyk and phosphofructokinase-encoding pfk enabled strain {GLY}2/{pCRD}500 to realize respective 13\% and 20\% improved rates of glucose consumption and alanine formation compared to {GLY}1/{pCRD}500. Subsequent overexpression of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase-encoding gpi in strain {GLY}3/{pCRD}500 further improved its glucose metabolism. Notably, both alanine productivity and yield increased after each overexpression step. After 48 h of incubation, {GLY}3/{pCRD}500 produced 2,430 {mM} alanine at a yield of 91.8\%. This was 6.4-fold higher productivity than that of the wild-type strain. Intracellular metabolite analysis showed that {gapA} overexpression led to a decreased concentration of metabolites upstream of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, suggesting that the overexpression resolved a bottleneck in glycolysis. Changing ratios of the extracellular metabolites by overexpression of glycolytic genes resulted in reduction of the intracellular {NADH}/{NAD}+ ratio, which also plays an important role on the improvement of glucose consumption. Enhanced alanine dehydrogenase activity using a high-copy-number plasmid further accelerated the overall alanine productivity. Increase in glycolytic enzyme activities is a promising approach to make drastic progress in growth-arrested bioprocesses.},

We provide a method to determine the steady states of this system that is tractable for metabolic networks of arbitrary complexity. We demonstrate our approach in a toy model first, and then in a genome-scale metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, obtaining results that are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. We derive a number of consequences from the model that are independent of parameter values. The ratio between cell density and dilution rate is an ideal control parameter to fix a steady state with desired metabolic properties. This conclusion is robust even in the presence of multi-stability, which is explained in our model by a negative feedback loop due to toxic byproduct accumulation. A complex landscape of steady states emerges from our simulations, including multiple metabolic switches, which also explain why cell-line and media benchmarks carried out in batch culture cannot be extrapolated to perfusion. On the other hand, we predict invariance laws between continuous cell cultures with different parameters. A practical consequence is that the chemostat is an ideal experimental model for large-scale high-density perfusion cultures, where the complex landscape of metabolic transitions is faithfully reproduced.},

	abstract = {Background
The efficacy of antibiotics against M. tuberculosis has been shown to be influenced by experimental media conditions. Investigations of M. tuberculosis growth in physiological conditions have described an environment that is different from common in vitro media. Thus, elucidating the interplay between available nutrient sources and antibiotic efficacy has clear medical relevance. While genome-scale reconstructions of M. tuberculosis have enabled the ability to interrogate media differences for the past 10 years, recent reconstructions have diverged from each other without standardization. A unified reconstruction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv would elucidate the impact of different nutrient conditions on antibiotic efficacy and provide new insights for therapeutic intervention.

Results
We present a new genome-scale model of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, named {iEK}1011, that unifies and updates previous M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome-scale reconstructions. We functionally assess {iEK}1011 against previous models and show that the model increases correct gene essentiality predictions on two different experimental datasets by 6\% (53\% to 60\%) and 18\% (60\% to 71\%), respectively. We compared simulations between in vitro and approximated in vivo media conditions to examine the predictive capabilities of {iEK}1011. The simulated differences recapitulated literature defined characteristics in the rewiring of {TCA} metabolism including succinate secretion, gluconeogenesis, and activation of both the glyoxylate shunt and the methylcitrate cycle. To assist efforts to elucidate mechanisms of antibiotic resistance development, we curated 16 metabolic genes related to antimicrobial resistance and approximated evolutionary drivers of resistance. Comparing simulations of these antibiotic resistance features between in vivo and in vitro media highlighted condition-dependent differences that may influence the efficacy of antibiotics.

Conclusions
{iEK}1011 provides a computational knowledge base for exploring the impact of different environmental conditions on the metabolic state of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. As more experimental data and knowledge of M. tuberculosis H37Rv become available, a unified and standardized M. tuberculosis model will prove to be a valuable resource to the research community studying the systems biology of M. tuberculosis.

By means of an extensivetestbed it is demonstrated that the new methodconverges faster and with more certainty than manyother acclaimed global optimization methods. The newmethod requires few control variables, is robust, easyto use, and lends itself very well to parallelcomputation.},

	abstract = {Differential evolution ({DE}) has recently proven to be an efficient method for optimizing real-valued multi-modal objective functions. Besides its good convergence properties and suitability for parallelization, {DE}'s main assets are its conceptual simplicity and ease of use. This paper describes several variants of {DE} and elaborates on the choice of {DE}'s control parameters, which corresponds to the application of fuzzy rules. Finally, the design of a howling removal unit with {DE} is described to provide a real-world example for {DE}'s applicability.},

	abstract = {We give a description of a Petri net-based framework for modelling and analysing biochemical pathways, which unifies the qualitative, stochastic and continuous paradigms. Each perspective adds its contribution to the understanding of the system, thus the three approaches do not compete, but complement each other. We illustrate our approach by applying it to an extended model of the three stage cascade, which forms the core of the {ERK} signal transduction pathway. Consequently our focus is on transient behaviour analysis. We demonstrate how qualitative descriptions are abstractions over stochastic or continuous descriptions, and show that the stochastic and continuous models approximate each other. A key contribution of the paper consists in a precise definition of biochemically interpreted stochastic Petri nets. Although our framework is based on Petri nets, it can be applied more widely to other formalisms which are used to model and analyse biochemical networks.},
