	abstract = {Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into nucleosome particles that occlude the {DNA} from interacting with most {DNA} binding proteins. Nucleosomes have higher affinity for particular {DNA} sequences, reflecting the ability of the sequence to bend sharply, as required by the nucleosome structure. However, it is not known whether these sequence preferences have a significant influence on nucleosome position in vivo, and thus regulate the access of other proteins to {DNA}. Here we isolated nucleosome-bound sequences at high resolution from yeast and used these sequences in a new computational approach to construct and validate experimentally a nucleosome–{DNA} interaction model, and to predict the genome-wide organization of nucleosomes. Our results demonstrate that genomes encode an intrinsic nucleosome organization and that this intrinsic organization can explain ∼50\% of the in vivo nucleosome positions. This nucleosome positioning code may facilitate specific chromosome functions including transcription factor binding, transcription initiation, and even remodelling of the nucleosomes themselves.},

This chapter also describes adapted procedures to prepare nucleosomes with histones from other species, and for the refolding and reconstitution of (H2A– H2B) dimers and (H3–H4)2 tetramers. Methods to reconstitute nucleosomes from different histone subcomplexes are described. A flow chart for all procedures involved in the preparation of synthetic nucleosomes is also presented.},

These determinants influence each other such that the resulting nucleosome positioning patterns are likely to differ among genes and among cells in a population, with consequent effects on gene expression.},

	abstract = {{DNA} sequences that position nucleosomes are of increasing interest because of their relationship to gene regulation in vivo and because of their utility in studies of nucleosome structure and function in vitro. However, at present our understanding of the rules for {DNA} sequence-directed nucleosome positioning is fragmentary, and existing positioning sequences have many limitations. We carried out a {SELEX} experiment starting with a large pool of chemically synthetic random. {DNA} molecules to identify those individuals having the highest affinity for histone octamer. A set of highest-affinity molecules were selected, cloned, and sequenced, their affinities (free energies) for histone octamer in nucleosome reconstitution measured, and their ability to position nucleosomes in vitro assessed by native gel electrophoresis. The selected sequences have higher affinity than previously known natural or non-natural sequences, and have a correspondingly strong nucleosome positioning ability. A variety of analyses including Fourier transform, real-space correlation, and direct counting computations were carried out to assess non-random features in the selected sequences. The results reveal sequence rules that were already identified in earlier studies of natural nucleosomal {DNA}, together with a large set of new rules having even stronger statistical significance. Possible physical origins of the selected molecules' high affinities are discussed. The sequences isolated in this study should prove valuable for studies of chromatin structure and function in vitro and, potentially, for studies in vivo.},

	abstract = {Dnmt1 epigenetically propagates symmetrical {CG} methylation in many eukaryotes. Their genomes are typically depleted of {CG} dinucleotides because of imperfect repair of deaminated methylcytosines. Here, we extensively survey diverse species lacking Dnmt1 and show that, surprisingly, symmetrical {CG} methylation is nonetheless frequently present and catalyzed by a different {DNA} methyltransferase family, Dnmt5. Numerous Dnmt5-containing organisms that diverged more than a billion years ago exhibit clustered methylation, specifically in nucleosome linkers. Clustered methylation occurs at unprecedented densities and directly disfavors nucleosomes, contributing to nucleosome positioning between clusters. Dense methylation is enabled by a regime of genomic sequence evolution that enriches {CG} dinucleotides and drives the highest {CG} frequencies known. Species with linker methylation have small, transcriptionally active nuclei that approach the physical limits of chromatin compaction. These features constitute a previously unappreciated genome architecture, in which dense methylation influences nucleosome positions, likely facilitating nuclear processes under extreme spatial constraints.},

	abstract = {{DNA} methylation and nucleosome positioning work together to generate chromatin structures that regulate gene expression. Nucleosomes are typically mapped using nuclease digestion requiring significant amounts of material and varying enzyme concentrations. We have developed a method ({NOMe}-seq) that uses a {GpC} methyltransferase (M.{CviPI}) and next generation sequencing to generate a high resolution footprint of nucleosome positioning genome-wide using less than 1 million cells while retaining endogenous {DNA} methylation information from the same {DNA} strand. Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and {DNA} methylation at {CTCF} regions that is not present at promoters. We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-{CpG} island promoters are nucleosome-depleted. Importantly, {NOMe}-seq obtains {DNA} methylation and nucleosome positioning information from the same {DNA} molecule, giving the first genome-wide {DNA} methylation and nucleosome positioning correlation at the single molecule, and thus, single cell level, that can be used to monitor disease progression and response to therapy.},
