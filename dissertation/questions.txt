EMSA SELEX introduction

- Existing studies suggest that CpG methylation affect nucleosome positioning.
  Why are we adding methylated cytosines at random (in addition to CpG
  methylation)? I refer to the half-methyl-C and all-methyl-C groups. Are there
  papers about this? Or is it sort of a control?
  
    Non-CpG methylation can be functional in stem cells and neural cells
    (e.g. https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3607). Our experiment data will
    be useful for understanding the nucleosome positioning there.
  
- It appears that other studies have uncovered 'rules' with regards to the base
  sequences that promote nucleosome binding. These were found by various
  methods. Lowary and Widom (1998) argue that such rules aren't strong, but
  this is quite an old study. 
  
  What advantages does SELEX offer over these other studies? Would this include
  an unbiased assessment of DNA-histone binding in vitro (as opposed to
  investigating existing sequences in living organisms)
  
    In the Lowary and Widom (1998) paper, they are carrying out almost the
    same SELEX experiment as us, but just limited by the sequencing
    capacity at that time. Compared to their work, our SELEX library is
    sequenced to a higher depth, allowing us to identify signals with
    higher information content. The main advantage of using SELEX over
    MNase-seq is that the random DNA library is much much more complexed
    than the genomic sequences, and is with a much much more homogeneous
    background sequence distribution.
  
PCR bias introduction

- Is there existing evidence that purification (e.g. by Ampure beads) introduces
  biases?
  
    In my previous SELEX batches, it seems that purification by Ampure
    beads biases C/G nucleotides.

METHODS

- Any details about sequencing? E.g. steps in processing. Will this be
  'interesting?'

notes

- any details about sequencing?
- i will add detail about methods for data analysis later
- i will replace figure 1 with a properly computer-drawn version later -- would
  a figure that looks like this look good?
- the blue dna is a placeholder image
- i'm yet to decide how much of the debugging i will include, but likely i'll
  cut out most of it
