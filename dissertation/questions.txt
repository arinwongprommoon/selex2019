EMSA SELEX introduction

- Existing studies suggest that CpG methylation affect nucleosome positioning.
  Why are we adding methylated cytosines at random (in addition to CpG
  methylation)? I refer to the half-methyl-C and all-methyl-C groups. Are there
  papers about this? Or is it sort of a control?
  
- It appears that other studies have uncovered 'rules' with regards to the base
  sequences that promote nucleosome binding. These were found by various
  methods. Lowary and Widom (1998) argue that such rules aren't strong, but
  this is quite an old study. 
  
  What advantages does SELEX offer over these other studies? Would this include
  an unbiased assessment of DNA-histone binding in vitro (as opposed to
  investigating existing sequences in living organisms)
  
PCR bias introduction

- Is there existing evidence that purification (e.g. by Ampure beads) introduces
  biases?
