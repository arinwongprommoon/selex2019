TO DO

- Make figures great again

  - Gel images: add ticks for weights; put ratios onto images in addition to
    caption

  - Blow up size of text on Python plots

  - Cut out a good chunk of the EMSA-SELEX PHP plots

  - Replace Fangjie's line plot with a dot plot

  - Make A-stretch plot more glamorous

  - Convert plots for individual nucleotides in linear model to dot plots, and
    make the vertical axis surround 0.25

- Introduction

  - WHY (biological question, biochemical question) -> WHAT -> HOW -> Conclusion
    work backwards to the key question

- Discussion

  - EMSA SELEX: talk about A-stretches -- this is a perfect thing to link to both
    previous research and physiological relevance --> WAIT ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T
    LOOK LIKE IT MAKES SENSE --> OH YEAH IT KIND OF DOES NOW

    - Try computing the A-stretch lengths using the 94N-bound and 94N-unbound
      datasets to confirm my assertions that the aberrant results are due to
      weak signals. ***

MORE QUESTIONS/ISSUES (2019-03-13)
 
- What is the significance of the amplitude of CG exhibiting a small decrease in
  the all-C-methylated and CpG methylated groups, the two groups in which all CG
  sequences are methylated at the cytosine? --> THE DECREASE PROBABLY ISN'T REAL,
  QUANTIFY ON DATA TO MAKE SURE ***

  DONE:
  plain 0.4392
  halfmc 0.2435
  allmc 0.2563
  cpg 0.2621

  so the decrease is definitely not real. The decrease from plain to the other
  groups is likely real though

Introduction notes from Jussi

We want to understand the effect of CpG methylation. THIS IS THE BROAD BIOLOGICAL QUESTION AND SHOULD BE NEAR THE BEGINNING OF THE DISSERTATION

Binding between the histone octamer and DNA is weak.  Why are we studying something that's weak?  The genome is BIG so the effect on the genome is significant.  In other words, the `law of big numbers' applies: any given interaction is stochastic, but because there are so many of them, it behaves like a deterministic model.  Effects on cellular fitness.
