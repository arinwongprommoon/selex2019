	abstract = {Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into nucleosome particles that occlude the {DNA} from interacting with most {DNA} binding proteins. Nucleosomes have higher affinity for particular {DNA} sequences, reflecting the ability of the sequence to bend sharply, as required by the nucleosome structure. However, it is not known whether these sequence preferences have a significant influence on nucleosome position in vivo, and thus regulate the access of other proteins to {DNA}. Here we isolated nucleosome-bound sequences at high resolution from yeast and used these sequences in a new computational approach to construct and validate experimentally a nucleosome–{DNA} interaction model, and to predict the genome-wide organization of nucleosomes. Our results demonstrate that genomes encode an intrinsic nucleosome organization and that this intrinsic organization can explain ∼50\% of the in vivo nucleosome positions. This nucleosome positioning code may facilitate specific chromosome functions including transcription factor binding, transcription initiation, and even remodelling of the nucleosomes themselves.},

However, at present our understanding of the rules for {DNA} sequence-directed nucleosome positioning is fragmentary, and existing positioning sequences have many limitations. We carried out a {SELEX} experiment starting with a large pool of chemically synthetic random. {DNA} molecules to identify those individuals having the highest affinity for histone octamer. A set of highest-affinity molecules were selected, cloned, and sequenced, their affinities (free energies) for histone octamer in nucleosome reconstitution measured, and their ability to position nucleosomes in vitro assessed by native gel electrophoresis. The selected sequences have higher affinity than previously known natural or non-natural sequences, and have a correspondingly strong nucleosome positioning ability. A variety of analyses including Fourier transform, real-space correlation, and direct counting computations were carried out to assess non-random features in the selected sequences. The results reveal sequence rules that were already identified in earlier studies of natural nucleosomal {DNA}, together with a large set of new rules having even stronger statistical significance. Possible physical origins of the selected molecules' high affinities are discussed. The sequences isolated in this study should prove valuable for studies of chromatin structure and function in vitro and, potentially, for studies in vivo.},

	abstract = {Dnmt1 epigenetically propagates symmetrical {CG} methylation in many eukaryotes. Their genomes are typically depleted of {CG} dinucleotides because of imperfect repair of deaminated methylcytosines. Here, we extensively survey diverse species lacking Dnmt1 and show that, surprisingly, symmetrical {CG} methylation is nonetheless frequently present and catalyzed by a different {DNA} methyltransferase family, Dnmt5. Numerous Dnmt5-containing organisms that diverged more than a billion years ago exhibit clustered methylation, specifically in nucleosome linkers. Clustered methylation occurs at unprecedented densities and directly disfavors nucleosomes, contributing to nucleosome positioning between clusters. Dense methylation is enabled by a regime of genomic sequence evolution that enriches {CG} dinucleotides and drives the highest {CG} frequencies known. Species with linker methylation have small, transcriptionally active nuclei that approach the physical limits of chromatin compaction. These features constitute a previously unappreciated genome architecture, in which dense methylation influences nucleosome positions, likely facilitating nuclear processes under extreme spatial constraints.},

Nucleosomes are typically mapped using nuclease digestion requiring significant amounts of material and varying enzyme concentrations. We have developed a method ({NOMe}-seq) that uses a {GpC} methyltransferase (M.{CviPI}) and next generation sequencing to generate a high resolution footprint of nucleosome positioning genome-wide using less than 1 million cells while retaining endogenous {DNA} methylation information from the same {DNA} strand. Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and {DNA} methylation at {CTCF} regions that is not present at promoters. We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-{CpG} island promoters are nucleosome-depleted. Importantly, {NOMe}-seq obtains {DNA} methylation and nucleosome positioning information from the same {DNA} molecule, giving the first genome-wide {DNA} methylation and nucleosome positioning correlation at the single molecule, and thus, single cell level, that can be used to monitor disease progression and response to therapy.},

Interestingly, the locations of the +1 nucleosome and {RNA} start sites shift in concert. Strikingly, in a foreign species, nucleosome-depleted regions occur fortuitously in coding regions, and they often act as promoters that are associated with a positioned nucleosome array linked to the length of the transcription unit.

Here, we describe a comprehensive analysis of {DNA} methylation patterns generated by high resolution sequencing of hairpin-bisulfite amplicons of selected single copy genes and repetitive elements ({LINE}1, B1, {IAP}-{LTR}-retrotransposons, and major satellites). The analysis unambiguously identifies a substantial amount of regional incomplete methylation maintenance, i.e. hemimethylated {CpG} positions, with variant degrees among cell types. Moreover, non-{CpG} cytosine methylation is confined to {ESCs} and exclusively catalysed by Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. This sequence position–, cell type–, and region-dependent non-{CpG} methylation is strongly linked to neighboring {CpG} methylation and requires the presence of Dnmt3L. The generation of a comprehensive data set of 146,000 {CpG} dyads was used to apply and develop parameter estimated hidden Markov models ({HMM}) to calculate the relative contribution of {DNA} methyltransferases (Dnmts) for de novo and maintenance {DNA} methylation. The comparative modelling included wild-type {ESCs} and mutant {ESCs} deficient for Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, or Dnmt3a/3b, respectively. The {HMM} analysis identifies a considerable de novo methylation activity for Dnmt1 at certain repetitive elements and single copy sequences. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b contribute de novo function. However, both enzymes are also essential to maintain symmetrical {CpG} methylation at distinct repetitive and single copy sequences in {ESCs}.},
