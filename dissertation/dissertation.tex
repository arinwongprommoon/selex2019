\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:emsaselex_intro}

\subsection{Physiological importance of the nucleosome, nucleosome occupancy, and gene expression}
\label{ssec:emsaselex_intro_importance}

Eukaryotes package their DNA into chromatin through a series of coiling steps.  The fundamental repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome.  The nucleosome consists of a histone octamer with 147 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around it.

Nucleosome positioning defines where nucleosomes are positioned within the genome \citep{struhl_determinants_2013}.  In contrast, nucleosome occupancy refers to the proportion of cells in a population that have a histone at a specific region in the genome. Nucleosome positioning and nucleosome occupancy are important determinants in gene expression because nucleosomes inhibit binding of DNA-binding proteins to DNA.  Specifically, nucleosome positioning inhibits transcription by preventing RNA polymerase from accessing chromatin, and prevent binding of transcription factors to regulatory elements.  In epigenetics, histone acetylation and methylation modulate the degree of packing of chromatin, and therefore affect acessibility of DNA-binding proteins to chromatin.

\subsection{Nucleosome sequence preferences}
\label{ssec:emsaselex_intro_seqpref}

For a given 147-bp DNA sequence, the affinity of the histone octamer can vary over more than three orders of magnitude.  This is because the nucleotide sequence and the methylation state of nucleotides affect the physical flexibility of DNA, which is required for the wrapping of DNA around histone octamers.

The dinucleotide sequences AA, AT, and TA confer high flexbility to DNA.  Therefore, they are situated on the face of the helical repeat that directly interacts with the histone octamer, with a periodicity of approximately 10 bp \citep{struhl_determinants_2013}.  GC dinucleotides also occur periodically, but out of phase with the aforementioned dinucleotides.  These preferences were confirmed by a yeast-based genome-wide assay, which identified DNA regions stably wrapped in nucleosomes, and the associated dinucleotide probability distributions contributed to a computational model that confirmed these preferences \citep{segal_genomic_2006}.  Experiments with synthetic DNA in SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) \citep{lowary_new_1998} have elucidated more rules for nucleosome positioning.  The `pentameric TG' sequence -- [(A or T)3NN(G or C)3NN]n -- has a very high affinity for the histone octamer, consistent with how AT-rich and GC-rich units confer flexibility of DNA.  `Phased TATA' sequences possessing multiple phased CTA trinucleotides also exhibit high affinity.

In contrast, the homopolymeric sequences poly(dA:dT) and poly(dG:dC) confer stiff structures that inhibit nucleosome formation.  These sequences are enriched in linker DNA between nucelosomes.  Poly(dA:dT) sequences are enriched in promoters, in particular that of \emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} \citep{struhl_determinants_2013}.  Depletion of nucleosomes at promoters on artificial chromosomes based on \emph{S. cerevisiae} genomic regions was shown to be dependent on the number and length of poly(dA:dT) sequences \citep{hughes_functional_2012}.

Additonally, DNA methylation disfavours nucleosome positioning \emph{in vivo}, as it increases the rigidity of DNA \citep{huff_dnmt1-independent_2014}.  Specifically, multiple tracts of methylated CpG sequences islands makes DNA have lower rise and twist along with higher roll values, thus making the DNA stiffer \citep{rao_systematic_2018, perez_impact_2012}.  However, the negative correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation varies according to the genomic location.  For example, this negative correlation holds for CTCF regions, but not at promoters \citep{kelly_genome-wide_2012}.

\subsection{Purpose of study}
\label{ssec:emsaselex_intro_why}

% Start with research questions/unknowns:
%   1. A clean in vitro investigation of sequence preference for CpG methylation is not available.
%   2. No-one has explored all-mC ligand preference.  This is important because CH methylation has physiological roles...

To date, clean \emph{in vitro} sequence preference data for CpG methylation is not available.  This is in contrast to sequence preference data derived from MNase-seq on existing genomes in previous studies \citep{struhl_determinants_2013, segal_genomic_2006, huff_dnmt1-independent_2014}.  Furthermore, there has been no exploration into the effects of CH methylation (non-CpG methylation) on sequence preferences of nucleosomes.  Although CpG methylation is the predominant chemical modification of eukaryotic DNA, playing roles in gene regulation and physiology, CH methylation regulates development of stem cells and neurons \citep{guo_distribution_2014}.

SELEX is a promising method to identify the DNA sequences preferred for nucleosome positioning.  Unlike MNase-seq, SELEX employs a random DNA library, which has a higher complexity than genomic sequences and a more homogenous background sequence distribution.  \citet{lowary_new_1998} employed SELEX in uncovering sequence-based rules for nucleosome positioning, but analysis was limited by the technology at the time.  This project extended on their study by employing sequencing to a higher depth, allowing identification of signals with higher information content.

In this project, I aimed to study the sequence specificity of the nucleosome on methylated and non-methylated DNA.  I conducted four cycles of nucleosome SELEX using random DNA as the initial input library.  In each cycle, I reconstituted nucleosomes from \emph{Xenopus laevis} histone octamer and 147-bp DNA \citep{dyer_reconstitution_2003} methylated at various levels.  This included CpG methylation, methylation at all cytosines, and methylation at half the cytosines.  I extracted the DNA bound to nucleosomes at each cycle for sequencing, then assessed the distribution of mononucleotides and dinucleotides using Fourier transform \citep{lowary_new_1998, zhu_interaction_2018}.  Subsequently, I investigated the effect of histone octamer binding on the enrichment of mononucleotides in the sequencing libraries by producing 9-mer plots.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{sec:emsaselex_methods}

\subsection{DNA ligand design and preparation}
\label{ssec:emsaselex_methods_lig}

The sequence of the initial input library is 5$'$ GCTCTTCCGATCT nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn AGATCGGAAGAGC 3$'$, where n denotes any nucleotide chosen at random. The input library DNA was made to 200 \SI{200}{\nano\Molar} in TE buffer with \SI{0.2}{\milli\Molar} EDTA.

PCR amplification was adapted from manufacturer's recommended protocols for Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (ThermoFisher, cat no F530).  The sequence of the forward primer was 5$'$ CCCTACACGAC GCTCTTCC 3$'$, and the sequence of the reverse primer was 3$'$ GCCTTCTCG TGTGCAGAC 5$'$.  Thirteen cycles of PCR with recommended temperatures were followed by ten cycles with the \SI{98}{\celsius} denaturation temperature replaced with \SI{72}{\celsius}.  For the `half-C-methylated group', half of the dCTPs were replaced with 5-methylcytosine, and for the `all-C-methylated group', all of the dCTPs were replaced with 5-methylcytosine.   For CpG-methylation, methyltransferase (M.SssI) was added to DNA in conjunction with S-adenosylmethionine and \ce{MgCl2}, then incubated according to manufacturer's protocols.

\subsection{SELEX}
\label{ssec:emsaselex_methods_selex}

Nucleosome reconstitution procedures were adapted from \citet{dyer_reconstitution_2003} (`Reconstitution of Nucleosome Core Particles'), using \SI{2}{\Molar} \ce{KCl}.  Histone:DNA ratios were 1.48:1, 0.74:1, 0.37:1, 0.19:1, and 0.09:1. % is the last part necessary given that I'm likely going to put it in a figure?

To verify results, reconstituted nucleosomes were analysed by EMSA by using TBE 6\% DNA retardation gel and 0.2\% TBE buffer on ice.  Gel bands corresponding to unbound DNA and to reconstituted nucleosomes were sliced.  The sliced bands were dissolved in \SI{70}{\micro\litre} Tris pH 8.0, and then incubated at \SI{70}{\celsius} overnight.

Eluted DNA was amplified using procedures adapted from manufacturer's recommended protocols for Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase.  Here, 21 cycles of PCR with a \SI{98}{\celsius} denaturation temperature and a \SI{67}{\celsius} annealing temperature was followed by ten cycles with a \SI{79}{\celsius} denaturation temperature and a \SI{64}{\celsius} annealing temperature.

\subsection{Sequencing}
\label{ssec:emsaselex_methods_seq}

After SELEX, the eluted DNA was barcoded for sequencing.  Amplification was carried out using the procedures recommended for Phusion DNA polymerase for 29 PCR cycles, using \SI{5}{\micro\Molar} barcoded PE primer obtained from IDT.  All barcoded DNA was then pooled together and purified using 1.2x AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter) according to manufacturer's protocols.  Subsequently, the DNA was diluted to \SI{2}{\nano\Molar}.  Illumina HiSeq 4000 was then used for sequencing, following standard protocols, with >60 bp paired-end settings.  Raw sequences are demultiplexed, then the R1 and R2 reads of paired-end sequencing were merged according to \citet{zhu_interaction_2018}.

\subsection{Data analysis}
\label{ssec:emsaselex_methods_anal}

Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) was performed using the position along the sequence read as the time domain and the frequency of mononucleotides or dinucleotides at a specific position within the sequence as the frequency domain, following \citet{zhu_interaction_2018}.  From this, power spectra for mononucleotides and dinucleotides were obtained.  The phase of FFT was also examined at 0.102 per base pair.

% This can easily be trivial information and will likely be deleted.
For each library, the frequency of all possible 9-mers of nucleotide sequences were counted.  x-y scatter plots were generated to compare the counts between libraries, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for each scatter plot.

  \caption{Overview of SELEX procedure}
  \label{fig:selex}
\end{figure}

Using the lig147 input library \citep{zhu_interaction_2018}, four cycles of EMSA SELEX (figure~\ref{fig:selex}) were carried out.  The experiment had four groups: plain DNA, CpG-methylated DNA, DNA with all cytosines methylated (all-C-methylated DNA), and DNA with half of its cytosines methylated (half-C-methylated DNA).

\subsection{Nucleosome reconstitution}
\label{ssec:reconstnuc}

EMSA in all cycles yielded strong bands corresponding to naked 147-base pair DNA. It also yielded bands corresponding to reconstituted nucleosomes that are fainter as the proportion of histone octamer decreased in the solution (figure~\ref{fig:reconstnuc}).

% add figures and references to relevant figures.  These include the PHP figures and my own figures (my figures deal with plain DNA and are honestly clearer)
DNA ligands that are not bound to nucleosomes and ligands that are bound to nucleosomes were eluted and then sequenced.

  \label{fig:enriched}
\end{figure}

From the obtained sequences, the frequency of all mononucleotide and dinucleotide sequences at each position along the reads were calculated.  All DNA libraries bound to nucleosomes clearly showed a clear periodicity in mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies, but the periodicity in the plain DNA libraries was less clear.
An additional library of plain DNA bound to nucleosomes prepared with additional rounds of AMPure bead purification to enrich the signals was analysed.  Characterisation of frequencies of mononucleotides at each position along the reads for this library yielded clear periodicities, which were confirmed by fast Fourier transform.  However, this library exhibited biases towards G and T nucleotides.

% kind of a placeholder at the moment...

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{emsacycle4all}
  \caption{Power spectra derived from the frequencies of all mononucleotide and dinucleotides}
  \label{fig:powerspectra}
\end{figure}

In contrast, all DNA libraries not bound to nucleosomes were depleted of this periodic signal.  This periodicity was assessed by fast Fourier transform, and the resulting power spectra showed that the periodicity was near 10 bp.  Specifically, half-C-methylated and all-C-methylated DNA showed the strongest signals, % QUESTION: quantification of strength/height of peak?
CpG-methylated DNA showed signals of intermediate strength, and plain DNA showed the weakest signals.  Among the histone octamer-to-DNA concentrations tested in nucleosome reconstitution, the 1:0.74 ratio gave rise to the strongest signals, and the signal intensity decreased as the proportion of DNA increased.  Libraries corresponding to this octamer:DNA ratio was used for all subsequent analyses.


\subsection{Sequence preferences of nucleosome}
\label{ssec:nuseqpref}
% ORIGINAL PLAN:
%% - The sequence preferences of nucleosome 
%% - Disfavored sequences of nucleosome
%% - Methylation effects on nucleosome’s sequence preference

The phase and the amplitude resulting from the fast Fourier transforms were then characterised, based on a frequency of 10.2 bp.

% I am not describing features in the plain DNA library here.  I don't think it's terribly interesting, and the figure shows them anyway.

When the cytosines were methylated, the amplitude for dinucleotides beginning with C increased, and their phases became more aligned. % topic sentence
Specifically, in the plain DNA library, the CA, CC, CG, and CT sequences were spread out over phases of \ang{80} to \ang{260}.  In the half-C-methylated and all-C-methylated libraries for the same octamer:DNA ratio, these sequences were spead out over phases of \ang{70} to \ang{140}.  These dinucleotides became more aligned to TC.  The phases of the reverse complements of these dinucleotides -- namely GA, GC, and GG -- also became more aligned when the cytosines are methylated.   Using the AA sequence as a reference, the amplitudes for CT and CA were greater in the all-C-methylated library than in the half-C-methylated library, but the amplitude for CG slightly reduced.
% QUESTION: is there a better way to describe the `spread' of the CX sequences to replace eyeballing and saying `yeah, it looks like they're less spread alright'.

These effects were less pronounced for CpG methylation. % topic sentence
Using the AA sequence as a reference, the amplitudes of CC and CT increased.  Similar to the other experimental groups, the amplitude of CG exhibited a slight decrease.  However, the CA, CC, CG, and CT sequences were still spread over a wide range of phases, covering \ang{80} to \ang{160}.

% Mention scatter plots, and describe axes and colours in the figure legends (admittedly the choice of colours is crap, but what can I do?  I don't have the scripts to generate the plots again)
% Write `no plain DNA plot because the signal was too weak' somewhere in the figure legends
% QUESTION: how the fuck did fangjie and jussi see that the smear of colours indicated enrichments in A and T?
For each library, the frequency of each possible continuous 9-mer of nucleotides was counted.

With the half-C-methylated, all-C-methylated, and CpG-methylated experimental groups, the unbound libraries were enriched in A and T compared to the bound libraries.  This effect was less significant when all cytosines were methylated.  However, both the bound and unbound all-C-methylated libraries were enriched in A and T as compared to the corresponding plain DNA libraries. % interpretation in discussion

%% After the DNA was eluted, barcodes were added using DreamTaq or Phusion (both ThermoFisher) as DNA polymerases.  Gel electrophoresis of the products amplified by DreamTaq yielded bands corresponding to 147 base pairs (figure~\ref{fig:barcoding_a}).  However, gel electrophoresis of the products amplified by Phusion using recommended protocols did not yield this band (figure~\ref{fig:barcoding_b}).

%% Repeating the Phusion amplification using qPCR yielded saturation curves (figure~\ref{fig:qpcr}), suggesting that amplification indeed took place.  As qPCR required a lower concentration of the template, it was hypothesised that Phusion initially failed because the ligand was too concentrated.  Different DNA polymerases from different vendors are efficient with differing template concentrations – for example, DreamTaq requires ... while Phusion requires ... (citation needed).  Therefore, I diluted the template DNA further by adding \SI{70}{\micro\litre} dilution buffer to each well. The resulting 8\% TBE gel yielded the band corresponding to 147 base pairs (figure~\ref{fig:barcoding_c}), confirming the hypothesis.

\chapter{PCR Bias}
\label{ch:pcrbias}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:pcrbias_intro}

\subsection{Origin of PCR bias}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_intro_origin}

PCR is a known source of bias in massively parallel sequencing \citep{olova_comparison_2018}.  Among the processes in Illumina sequencing, PCR amplification during library preparation has been identified as the major source of bias.
% The corresponding figure from Aird et al. would be useful here
\citet{aird_analyzing_2011} measured frequencies of amplicons of varying GC content after each step in library preparation for Illumina sequencing, and found that DNA shearing, adapter ligation, gel size selection did not significantly introduce biases in response to GC content.  However, PCR depleted loci with GC content exceeding 65\% to the order of 1\% of the reference loci with intermediate GC content, and it also depleted loci with GC content lower than 12\% to the order of 10\% of the reference loci.  This pattern was observed even for 10 PCR cycles.

% == Not relevant to project ==
%Furthermore, amplification-free sequencing methods exhibited less bias than methods that rely on sequencing.  The amplification-free Pacific Biosciences sequencing introduced the least bias, followed by Illumina and Ion Torrent sequencing \citep{ross_characterizing_2013}. All methods exhibited biases for extremely low and extremely high GC content as described by \citet{aird_analyzing_2011}, but combining data from two sequencing technologies has been shown to potentially reduce bias.  However, amplification-free sequencing requires higher amounts of input DNA and more complicated experimental operations compared to sequencing methods that require amplification.

There are methods to mitigate this bias.  \citet{aird_analyzing_2011} found that this bias can be reduced by slowing the temperature ramping speed of thermocyclers, extending denaturation steps, and adding \SI{2}{\Molar} betaine.

Additionally, the choice of DNA polymerase enzyme has an effect.  Phusion DNA polymerase is commonly used because it has higher processivity and fidelity than most polymerases \citep{quail_optimal_2012}. Trying to reduce PCR bias by adding betaine and prolonging the denaturation step leads to a loss of high-AT sequences.  \citet{aird_analyzing_2011} also showed that replacing Phusion with AccuPrime Taq HiFi polymerase improved PCR bias.  Extension at \SI{60}{\celsius} using this enzyme retained more low-GC sequences, but also led to a decrease in yield of GC-rich reads.  \citet{quail_optimal_2012} showed that replacing Phusion with Kapa HiFi led to a more uniformm genome coverage.  However, this also led to a higher error rate, especially in TA-rich regions that Phusion often fails to amplify.

\subsection{How PCR bias affects reliability of sequencing results}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_intro_effects}

Commonly-used model organisms have GC content within the range in which bias is least likely introduced.  \emph{E. coli} and humans have genomes that have moderate GC content, with \emph{E. coli} having a GC content of 51\%.  PCR bias is still significant for these model organisms as they have important sequences that may be affected by PCR bias.  This includes single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and GC-rich sequences like transcription start sites and first exons in eukaryotes.  %Additionally, humans exhibit `bad promoters'. % expand on the `bad promoters' data set from Ross et al.  Where did they get them, and what is their importance?

\subsection{Purpose of study}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_intro_why}

% QUESTION: evidence? is this actually true? ask fangjie
Although it is well-characterised that PCR introduces sequence biases, it is unknown which process within procedures that employ PCR amplification contributes the most to this bias, and to which degree.  Specifically, the biases introduced from the number of PCR cycles and from purification have not been characterised.  Such characterisation would be beneficial in developing a model to quantify PCR bias.  With such a model, these PCR biases can be removed in genomic studies to reveal true signals introduced by the factors tested in the relevant experiments.  PCR bias is especially relevant for nucleosome EMSA-SELEX employed in this project.  Sequence affinities for the nucleosome is weak, making the signal enrichment in the sequencing library weak, and makes it difficult to separate true signals introduced by nucleosome binding from biases introduced by PCR.  Both sequences bound to nucleosomes and sequences that are not exhibit the same PCR-introduced bias, rather than have biases that separate these two groups.

Here I assesed the sequence biases that could be introduced to the initial input library for nucleosome EMSA-SELEX.  I tested sequence biases introduced by the choice of DNA polymerase, choice of reagents, cycles of PCR, and purification of DNA after PCR.  From the resulting sequencing data, I assessed the distribution of k-mer nucleotides.  The experimental data led to constructing a model to account for PCR bias from these sources.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{sec:pcrbias_methods}

\subsection{DNA ligand design and preparation}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_methods_lig}

The same input library as \ref{ssec:emsaselex_methods_lig} was used, without methylation.

\subsection{Biases from enzymes}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_methods_enz}

PCR amplification followed manufacturers' specification for the following DNA polymerases: Phire Hot Start II DNA polymerase (ThermoFisher, F122S), Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, M0493S), DreamTaq Hot Start DNA Polymerase (ThermoFisher, EP1701), and Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (ThermoFisher, F530L).

For each enzyme, the input library was diluted by factors and then amplified for numbers of cycles as specified:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Dilute by a factor of $2^{4}$, then amplify for 8 cycles
  \item Dilute by a factor of $2^{8}$, then amplify for 12 cycles
  \item Dilute by a factor of $2^{12}$, then amplify for 16 cycles
  \item Dilute by a factor of $2^{16}$, then amplify for 20 cycles
  \item Dilute by a factor of $2^{20}$, then amplify for 24 cycles
\end{itemize}
    
To investigate bottleneck effects, the product from 24-cycle amplification was diluted by a factor of $2^{20}$.  From this, three samples were taken to be amplified using 24 cycles.

\subsection{Biases from PCR cycles}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_methods_pcr}

lig147 was diluted by a factor of $2^{20}$.  PCR amplification followed manufacturer's specification for Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (ThermoFisher, F530L).  DNA was amplified for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 cycles, then re-diluted so that theoretical concentrations matched DNA that was amplified for 4 cycles.

\subsection{Biases from purification}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_methods_pur}

lig147 was purified using 1.2x Ampure beads (Agen Court AMPure) according to manufacturer's protocols, but with a \SI{15}{\micro\litre} elution volume.  Purification was repeated for 1, 2, 4, and 8 times.

\subsection{Biases from reagent vendors}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_methods_reagent}

lig147 was diluted by a factor of $2^{20}$.  It was then amplified for 24 cycles using manufacturer's specification for PCR amplification using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (ThermoFisher, F530L) and the reagents supplied by this vendor.

Combinations of Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase and dNTPs were investigated.  The polymerases used were from ThermoFisher (F530L) and New England BioLabs (M0530L).  The dNTPs used were from ThermoFisher (R0192), Agilent Technologies (200415-51), Kapa Biosystems (KN1009), and dNTPs containing 5-methylcytosine in place of dCTP from Zymo Research (D1030).  Twenty-four cycles of PCR using the eight combinations of polymerases and dNTPs proceeded according to manufacturer's specification for Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (ThermoFisher, F530L).

\subsection{Sequencing}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_methods_seq}

The same procedures for sequencing as \ref{ssec:emsaselex_methods_seq} were used.

\subsection{Data analysis}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_methods_anal}

The same methods for fast Fourier transform and k-mer plot generation as \ref{ssec:emsaselex_methods_anal} were used.
% I can see this moved to results very easily
To investigate the effect of different vendors, a linear regression model was constructed.  The model used the frequencies of each nucleotide in the amplified library as the response variable.  The input variables were the enzyme vendor and dNTP vendor.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:pcrbias_results}

For each library, the frequency of each possible continuous 9-mer of nucleotides was counted.

\subsection{Biases from enzymes}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_result_enz}

Libraries amplified by Phusion, Phire, Dreamtaq, and Q5 DNA polymerase enzymes were analysed.  The initial input library was lig147.  For each enzyme, the library from 24 cycles of PCR was compared to the library from 8 cycles of PCR. % weak signals from 0 cycles, so there weren't used (I think)
All enzymes exhibit biases towards A and T, with Phusion exhibiting the weakest bias and Phire exhibiting the strongest bias.

\subsection{Biases from purification}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_result_pur}

Eight rounds of purification of the lig147 input library by AMPure beads did not introduce measurable nucleotide biases.

\subsection{Biases from reagent vendors}
\label{ssec:pcrbias_result_reagent}

Different combinations of vendors for dNTPs and Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerases for PCR were investigated.  The fractions of each nucleotide after 24 rounds of amplification were calculated for each combination.  These fractions were then used to construct a linear model % add reference to equation
to describe the effects of dNTP and Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase vendor on the fraction of the nucleotides. % add reference to table and verification of model by scatter plot
